# Hello user and welcome to my 'Superpy' project!

## With this project you can practice managing supermarket products as if it is your own supermarket. And most importantly, this project will also help you on how to avoid wasting products to help making our world a better and durable place.



This project is a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) project, which means that you can only use this project in a terminal; for example 'Windows terminal' / 'Windows PowerShell'.

If you want to use my project, the only things you have to do is:

* Copy one of the codes as shown below in the screenshot
* Paste the code in your terminal as shown below in the screenshot
* Press 'Enter' on your keyboard


After pressing 'Enter' on your keyboard, my code will guide you step by step on all the things you can do with my project. And if you accidentally typed something wrong, no worries. My code will also guide you on how to correct it.

Have fun managing with **Superpy**!
