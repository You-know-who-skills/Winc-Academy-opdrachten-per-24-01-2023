# Hello user and welcome to my 'Superpy' project!

## With this project you can practice managing supermarket products as if it is your own supermarket.



This project is a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) project, which means that you can only use this project in a terminal; for example 'Windows terminal' / 'Windows PowerShell'.

If you want to use my project, the only things you have to do is:

* copy de code below
* paste it in your terminal as shown below in the screenshot
* press 'Enter' on your keyboard


After pressing 'Enter' on your keyboard, my code will guide you step by step on all the things you can do. And if you accidentally typed something wrong, no worries. My code will also guide you on how to correct it.

Have fun managing with **Superpy**!
